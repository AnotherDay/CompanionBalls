## Quick Start Guide

First click the connect button, the connection is established once the Sphero turns white.
If a connection error comes up (like "SEVERE: 	Failed to connect to the robot bluetooth connection") close the program and try to connect again

When the Sphero is connected to the computer hit the button Initialize Robot Controller. It should now be ready to control with the directional keys.

To control another Sphero over a network connection do the steps above and hit the server button (Named "THIS IS SERVER").
